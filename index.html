            <p>Hi I’m Candace - a front-end Web Application Developer and a student in the Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful, currently living in Indianapolis, IN.  
            I am extremely passionate about coding and web development -I just love solving complex problems and creating clean and irresistible designs.  My favorite part of the web development process is writing high order functions to make my pages come to life  I thrive by my ability to throw myself into a project and take the time and care necessary to make everything just right.
            I also come from a unique background for a developer- I have a B.S. in Meteorology and a M.S. in Geographic Information Design from Ball State University.  The mixture of intertwining logic and puzzle-solving is what drew me to a career in coding; however, don’t be surprised if you see me on occasion geeking out over a thunderstorm or an interesting map. When I’m outside of the office, I’m often found looking up new recipes to try, tending to my urban garden, or spending time with my husband and birds.
